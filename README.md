## Git Practice Guide
* To do a development, should create a **feature branch** from **develop**. E.g. feature/abc
* The develop and master branch are protected. You could not commit/push into them directly.
* When you want to merge you feature branch into develop, you should create a pull request on GitHub and assign a reviewer to approve merging.
* Your should pull(merge) develop into your feature branch that make your feature branch up-to-date.
* Do not pull(merge) master into your feature branch because it is older than develop branch. Imagine that master branch is a production version (It should only contain the statble code).
* You could google **git flow** development practice.
